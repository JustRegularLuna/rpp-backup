# Pokémon Red++

This is based on the [**Pokémon Red Disassembly**][pokered]

Red++ serves as an updated version of Pokémon Red.

It fixes a lot of bugs leftover from original Red and Blue, as well as adding new features.
It builds two versions, a "Normal" version and a "Hard" version. The only difference is the level curve.

For a list of features, check out [**FEATURES.md**](FEATURES.md).

* To see a list of all Pokémon included, look [**here**] (constants/pokemon_constants.asm).
* To see Pokémon skill sets and evolutions, look [**here**](data/evos_moves.asm).
* To see what the TMs teach, and where to find them, look [**here**] (data/tms.asm).
* To see Pokémon base stats, moves known at lv 1, and which TMs they learn, look [**here**] (data/baseStats/).
